# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Ed25519 Signature Generation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the core cryptographic functionality for generating Ed25519 signatures.
# Details:
1. Install and configure Node.js Crypto module
2. Implement Ed25519 key pair generation
3. Create signature generation function using file hash, Gmail address, and timestamp
4. Implement signature data structure as per PRD
5. Store private key securely in Vercel environment variables

# Test Strategy:
Unit test signature generation, verify signature format, test with various input combinations, ensure private key is not exposed

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install and Configure Node.js Crypto Module [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the development environment by installing and configuring the Node.js Crypto module for Ed25519 operations.
### Details:
Use npm to install the required crypto module. Verify the installation and import the module in the project. Ensure the module supports Ed25519 operations.

## 2. Implement Ed25519 Key Pair Generation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a function to generate Ed25519 key pairs for signature creation and verification.
### Details:
Use the crypto module to implement a function that generates an Ed25519 key pair. Ensure the function returns both the public and private keys in the appropriate format.

## 3. Create Signature Generation Function [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a function that generates an Ed25519 signature using a file hash, Gmail address, and timestamp.
### Details:
Implement a function that takes a file hash, Gmail address, and timestamp as inputs. Concatenate these inputs in a specified order, then use the private key to generate an Ed25519 signature of this data.

## 4. Implement Signature Data Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a data structure to store and represent the generated signature along with its associated metadata as specified in the PRD.
### Details:
Design and implement a data structure (e.g., a JavaScript object) that includes fields for the signature, public key, timestamp, and any other required metadata. Ensure the structure matches the specifications in the PRD.

## 5. Securely Store Private Key in Vercel Environment [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a secure method to store the generated Ed25519 private key in Vercel environment variables.
### Details:
Create a script to securely generate and store the Ed25519 private key as a Vercel environment variable. Implement safeguards to prevent accidental exposure of the key in logs or error messages.
