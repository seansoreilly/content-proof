# Task ID: 5
# Title: Develop QR Code Generation and Embedding
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create functionality to generate QR codes with embedded signature data and implement the self-contained verification link.
# Details:
1. Choose and integrate a QR code generation library
2. Implement JSON to Base64URL encoding for signature data
3. Create the self-contained verification link structure
4. Generate QR codes with the correct size and error correction level
5. Implement QR code download functionality

# Test Strategy:
Test QR code generation with various signature data, verify QR code scannability, check embedded data accuracy, test QR code download

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate QR Code Generation Library [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Research, select, and integrate a suitable QR code generation library into the project.
### Details:
1. Research QR code libraries compatible with the project's tech stack. 2. Select a library based on performance, ease of use, and maintenance. 3. Install the chosen library using the project's package manager. 4. Create a wrapper module to abstract the library's functionality for easier use in the project.

## 2. Implement JSON to Base64URL Encoding [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a function to convert JSON signature data to Base64URL encoding for compact representation in QR codes.
### Details:
1. Implement a function that takes a JSON object as input. 2. Convert the JSON to a string. 3. Encode the string to Base64. 4. Make the Base64 URL-safe by replacing '+' with '-', '/' with '_', and removing padding '='. 5. Return the resulting Base64URL string.

## 3. Create Self-Contained Verification Link Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the structure for self-contained verification links that will be encoded in QR codes.
### Details:
1. Define the URL structure for verification links (e.g., https://example.com/verify?data=<encoded_data>). 2. Create a function that takes the Base64URL encoded data and constructs the full verification URL. 3. Implement input validation to ensure the encoded data doesn't exceed URL length limits.

## 4. Generate QR Codes with Correct Parameters [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Use the integrated QR code library to generate codes with the proper size and error correction level, containing the verification links.
### Details:
1. Determine the optimal QR code size based on the expected scanning distance and device capabilities. 2. Choose an appropriate error correction level (e.g., 'M' for 15% error correction). 3. Create a function that takes a verification link as input and returns a QR code image with the specified parameters. 4. Implement error handling for cases where the data is too large for the chosen QR code size.

## 5. Implement QR Code Download Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a feature allowing users to download the generated QR codes in various image formats.
### Details:
1. Implement functions to convert the QR code to common image formats (PNG, JPEG, SVG). 2. Create API endpoints or UI elements for triggering QR code downloads. 3. Implement proper error handling and success feedback for the download process. 4. Ensure appropriate file naming and MIME types for downloaded files.
