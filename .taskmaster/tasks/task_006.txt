# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Signature Verification System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the client-side signature verification process, including file hash comparison and Ed25519 signature verification.
# Details:
1. Implement file hash calculation for uploaded files
2. Develop Ed25519 signature verification logic
3. Create verification result display component
4. Implement error handling for verification process
5. Ensure offline functionality with cached public key

# Test Strategy:
Test verification with valid and invalid signatures, check offline functionality, verify error handling for various scenarios

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement File Hash Calculation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a function to calculate the SHA-256 hash of uploaded files on the client-side.
### Details:
Use the Web Crypto API to implement SHA-256 hash calculation. Create a utility function that takes a File object as input and returns a Promise resolving to the hash as a hexadecimal string.

## 2. Develop Ed25519 Signature Verification Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Implement the core logic for verifying Ed25519 signatures using the calculated file hash and provided signature.
### Details:
Use a WebAssembly-compiled library like TweetNaCl.js for Ed25519 operations. Create a function that takes the file hash, signature, and public key as inputs and returns a boolean indicating whether the signature is valid.

## 3. Create Verification Result Display Component [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Develop a React component to display the results of the signature verification process to the user.
### Details:
Create a new React component that takes verification results as props and renders appropriate success or failure messages, along with relevant details like the file name and hash.

## 4. Implement Error Handling for Verification Process [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2, 6.3
### Description: Add comprehensive error handling to the verification process, including user-friendly error messages for various failure scenarios.
### Details:
Identify potential error scenarios (e.g., invalid file format, network issues, invalid signature format) and implement try-catch blocks or error boundaries as appropriate. Update the result display component to show specific error messages.

## 5. Ensure Offline Functionality with Cached Public Key [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2, 6.4
### Description: Implement a mechanism to cache the public key locally and enable signature verification without an internet connection.
### Details:
Use browser's local storage or IndexedDB to cache the public key. Modify the verification process to first attempt to use the cached key, falling back to fetching from the server if not available. Implement a background sync to update the cached key when online.
